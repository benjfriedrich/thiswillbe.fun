## Technical Skills

### HTML 5 / CSS 3

If it can be done using HTML and CSS, I can do it. I'm primo at this stuff.

### Javascript

I'm good at javascript, but still growing. Capable of using established libraries and building my own tools. My focus is mostly on DOM manipulation--I don't have expertise building out elaborate API driven web apps, or anything like that.

I stick mostly to vanilla Javascript, but occasionally I get into some jQuery.

For most of my projects, a full javascript framework would be overkill, so I don't claim expertise in any of the primary frameworks. More coming here though.

### JAMstack

I'm a big fan of using static site generators to build websites, distributing them using a CDN, rather than running everything on a server. It's not the best solution for every site, but it's a flexible, secure, and robust way to manage a site.

I have experience using both **Hugo** and **Jekyll** as static site generators. They're both great.

I'm a huge fan of using **Netlify** as a build and content distribution tool.

I use **Github** to manage the codebase--it integrates fantastically with Netlify.

There are a bunch of good client facing content managment tools. I've found **Foresty.io** to be a good option for most.

**Snipcart** is a good way to handle online commerce.


### Traditional Stack

JAMstack is cool, but I love **Wordpress** too. I'm not a **PHP** whiz, but I'm a champ at using it for templating Wordpress themes.

I claim no expertise in building out complicated, high-load back-ends, but for small projects, it's really easy to toss up a virtual private server on **Digital Ocean** or **Linode**, install **Apache** or **NGINX**, and serve up a Wordpress site from there.


### WYSIWYG

Depending on the client, there are times when the best solution is actually a service like **Squarespace**. It's limiting in lots of ways, but if you play by its rules, Sqaurespace can empower clients who need something made quickly that can be modified easily.


## Creative Skills

### Graphic Design

Graphic Design is funny, because it’s not a very concrete discipline. You can be a fantastic designer and have relatively little technical “artistic” skill, because it’s about coordinating art, typography, and copy with your communication goals. But none-the-less it is hard to disentangle a designer’s skill as a designer from their skill as an artist.

I’m an Adobe guy, so my design workflow revolves around Illustrator and Indesign.

Fortunately, I think of myself as being pretty good at both. If you want a taste, check out my Portfolizine. It’s cooler in person, but the online version is fun too.


### UI/UX Design

UI/UX design is about creating natural, beautiful interactions. I don’t focus on complicated framework-driven web-apps, so my goal is usually to make the “interface” for a website as invisible as possible. I categorize this as a creative discipline, but having an extensive technical knowledge base is really important in designing interfaces that work for both the developer and the user.

A good example of a UI that I designed is the online store for my favorite coffee shop, Euphoria in West Union, IA. 

### Digital Illustration

There are many different styles of illustration, and sadly there is no way to master them all. I’ve tried.

My style as an illustrator is high contrast, shape based illustration. Good colors are the key to good art, in my telling. I’ve specifically developed my illustration skills to ingrate with my design goals—I tend to use vector files, and layer in textures only when I actually want to go bitmap.

I’ve done a wide variety of illustration over the years, and was even the in-house illustrator for a news start-up website called ‘the Block’ for a while.

### Photography

I’m a good documentary, environmental product, and environmental portrait photographer. I shoot really lean—typically just an old Fuji XT-1, a few lenses, and sometimes an off-camera speed-light flash. 

I also take beautiful pictures of my cats, thought that doesn’t feel particularly germane.

My niche is being the type of guy who can get in and get some good shots without having to go through the hassle of setting up a big shoot with a full-time pro photographer. There are definitely things a full-time pro photographer is better set up for than I am, but a lot of times you just need something that looks good and won’t blow your budget.

### Copywriting

Good copy is a vital part of any design.

People get bored easily. They don’t like reading.

So you have to trick them into reading. It’s not easy.

You do this by keeping it simple. 

Once you’ve earned their attention, you can start adding in a few subtleties and flourishes, but not until you’ve earned it.

I spend most of my time on illustration and design these days, but I went to school for copywriting, and have leaned on it ever since. It’s a skill that I use every day.

### Web-based Animation

Animation on the web has a lot of technical constraints. So it’s really important to embrace those limitations. 

But you can achieve really cool effects, with relatively
simple animations. 

The landing page for this website is a bit overkill, but you can see how they can make your experience on the web more engaging.
