## Technical Skills

### HTML 5 / CSS 3

If it can be done using HTML and CSS, I can do it. I'm primo at this stuff.

### Javascript

I'm good at javascript, but still growing. Capable of using established libraries and building my own tools. My focus is mostly on DOM manipulation--I don't have expertise building out elaborate API driven web apps, or anything like that.

I stick mostly to vanilla Javascript, but occasionlly I get into some jQuery.

For most of my projects, a full javascript framework would be overkill, so I don't claim expertise in any of the primary frameworks. More coming here though.

### JAMstack

I'm a big fan of using static site generators to build websites, distributing them using a CDN, rather than running everything on a server. It's not the best solution for every site, but it's a flexible, secure, and robust way to manage a site.

I have experience using both **Hugo** and **Jekyll** as static site generators. They're both great.

I'm a huge fan of using **Netlify** as a build and content distribution tool.

I use **Github** to manage the codebase--it integrates fantistically with Netlify.

There are a bunch of good client facing content mangament tools. I've found **Foresty.io** to be a good option for most.

**Snipcart** is a good way to handle online commerce.


### Traditional Stack

JAMstack is cool, but I love **Wordpress** too. I'm not a **PHP** whiz, but I'm a champ at using it for templating Wordpress themes.

I claim no expertise in building out complicated, high-load back-ends, but for small projects, it's really easy to toss up a virtual private server on **Digital Ocean** or **Linode**, install **Apache** or **NGINX**, and serve up a Wordpress site from there.


### WYSIWYG

Depending on the client, there are times when the best solution is actually a service like **Squarespace**. It's limiting in lots of ways, but if you play by it's rules, Sqaurespace can empower clients who need something made quickly that can be modified easily.
