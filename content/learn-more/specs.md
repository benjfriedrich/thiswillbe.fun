## Technical Skills

### HTML 5 / CSS 3

**If it can be done using HTML and CSS, I can do it.** I'm primo at this stuff. Mobile-first, flexible layouts.

Most of the HTML/CSS work I do these days takes place in the context of templating systems or frameworks, but that doesn’t diminish their importance as the foundational vocabulary of front-end web design. 

### Frontend JavaScript

I'm good at javascript, but still growing. Capable of **using established libraries** and **building my own tools**. I've done my share direct **DOM manipulation** for simple tasks, but I've been focused on using more robust tools like **React** and **Svelte** to help make complex apps more maintainable.

My style is frontend heavy, and I like working with **REST APIs** and query tools like **GraphQL**.

I stick mostly to **ES6 Javascript**, but I’m not afraid of jQuery or Typescript or anything.

For context, for a long time I was writing light-weight, spaghetti javascript (using simple libraries and writing basic functions). I didn’t think of myself as coder—I was just a designer—so I just did the bare minimum to achieve functionality.  

**But then one afternoon, when I was debugging a sloppy mess I had made, I realized I *was* a coder. I was writing code. And I liked writing code. So why not learn to write good code.**

 So I decided to expand my front-end development capability and started treating JS and web-development in general more seriously, and since then have turned it into a proficiency.


### JAMstack

I'm a big fan of using static site generators to build websites, distributing them using a CDN, rather than running the site on a dedicated server.

I have a lot of experience using **Hugo** and **Jekyll** as static site generators. Recently I've focused more on tools like **Gatsby.js** and **Sapper** that enable you to use more robust front-end frameworks in a serverless context.

I'm a huge fan of using **Netlify** as a build and content distribution tool.

I use **Github** to manage codebases—it integrates fantastically with Netlify.

If I need a server-side style work done, I like spinning up **AWS Lambda**, and using **Node.JS** to do the job.
 
There are a bunch of good client facing content managment tools. I've worked with **Foresty.io** and **sanity.io**. 


### Traditional Stack

JAMstack is cool, but I like **Wordpress** too. I'm not a **PHP** whiz, but I'm a champ at using it for templating Wordpress themes.

I claim no expertise in building out complicated, high-load back-ends, but for small projects, it's really easy to toss up a virtual private server on **Digital Ocean** or **Linode**, install **Apache** or **NGINX**, and serve up a Wordpress site from there.


### WYSIWYG

Depending on the client, there are times when the best solution is actually a service like **Squarespace**. It's limiting in lots of ways as a developer, but if you play by its rules, Sqaurespace can empower clients who need something made quickly that can be modified easily.


### Examples

*Almost* every line of code on this site is me, but here are a few other sites I've worked on that are cool. I've been pivoting back to web-design recently, so I'm rebuilding my professional portfio from scratch:

[Euphoria Coffee](https://drinkeuphoria.coffee): A Gatsby/React site with a snipcart powered online store.

[My Portfolio](https://benjaminfriedrich.com): My portfolio of graphics, web-work, and photography.

[BNJMN](https://BNJMN.US): My personal site.

## Creative Skills

### Graphic Design

Graphic Design is funny, because it’s not a very concrete discipline. You can be a fantastic designer and have relatively little technical “artistic” skill, because **it’s about coordinating art, typography, and copy with your communication goals**. But none-the-less it is hard to disentangle a designer’s skill as a designer from their skill as an artist.

Fortunately, I think of myself as being pretty good at both. If you want a taste, check out my Portfolizine. It’s cooler in person, but the online version is fun too.

I’m an Adobe guy, so my design workflow revolves around Illustrator and Indesign.

### UI/UX Design

UI/UX design is about creating **natural, beautiful interactions.** I don’t focus on complicated framework-driven web-apps, so **my goal is usually to make the “interface” for a website as invisible as possible.** I categorize this as a creative discipline, but having an extensive technical knowledge base is really important in designing interfaces that work for both the developer and the user.

A good example of a UI that I designed is the online store for my favorite coffee shop, [Euphoria Coffee](https://drinkeuphoria.coffee) in West Union, IA. 

### Digital Illustration

My style as an illustrator is high-contrast, shape-driven illustration. **Good colors are the key to impactful art.** 

I’ve specifically developed my illustration skills to ingrate with my design goals. I tend to use vector files, and layer in textures only when I actually want to go bitmap. Layers of flexibility.

I’ve done a wide variety of illustration over the years, and was even the in-house illustrator for a crypto/fin-tech news website called ‘the Block’ for a while.

### Photography

I’m a good documentary and environmental product photographer. I shoot really lean—typically just an old Fuji XT-1, a few fast prime lenses, and sometimes an off-camera speed-light flash. 

I’m a champ of taking advantage of that blurry background bokeh effect that everyone loves.

My niche is being the type of guy who can go in quick and get some good shots without the hassle of setting up a big shoot with a full-time pro photographer. 

There are definitely things a full-time pro photographer is better set up for than I am, but a lot of times you just need something that looks good and won’t blow your budget.

I also take beautiful pictures of my cats, which, as you well know, is a fundamental internet skill.


### Copywriting

Good copy is a vital part of any design.

People get bored easily. They don’t like reading.

So you have to trick them into reading. It’s not easy.

You do this by keeping it simple. 

Once you’ve earned their attention, you can start adding in a few subtleties and flourishes, but not until you’ve earned it.

I spend most of my time on illustration and design these days, but I went to school for copywriting, and have leaned on it ever since. It’s a skill that I use every day.

### Web-based Animation

Animation on the web has a lot of technical constraints. So it’s really important to embrace those limitations. 

But you can achieve really cool effects, with relatively
simple animations. 

The landing page for this website is a bit overkill, but you can see how they can make your experience on the web more engaging.
