## Hi, I'm Benjamin

My philosophy of web design is simple. Websites should be fun. 

Obviously websites should be functional and easy to use. 

That's first. But that's boring. You can do better. 

Make them fun too!

That doesn’t mean they need to be extravagant or technically sophisticated. But they should have a sense of play and excitement built in from the very start.

This means different things in different contexts, and doesn’t apply to the same degree in every situation. 

But any time one of your goals is get people excited about you, it’s important that you communicate that you are excited to be you. 

You do this by having fun.

## Ummm...what even does that mean?

Fun! Just make your site fun. There's no formula. 

But ok, yes. I can see how that's unhelpful.

**Here's what fun might look like:**

Sometimes it might mean investing in beautiful illustration or photography and letting it shine. 

Sometimes it might mean building in special interactions and animations.

Sometimes it might not even be part of the web design itself. If the site is built around recurring content (say...a blog) that content can be the source of fun.

But your site can't just be fun. It needs to be fast too.

## This entire website is 654kb. That's very small.

That’s kilobytes. The one that’s smaller than megabytes. 

This entire website is smaller than most banner images. 

*But wait...does that includes all the fun images and animations on the home page?*

Yes. Those too.

Being fun doesn’t mean building a bulky, boorish website that *might* be fun if you have a perfect connection.

Guess what. No one has a perfect conection.

One thing that is not fun is waiting for a site to load.

## Full-Stack, except different

'Full-stack' is a term from the development world for a developer who is skilled at every level of development. 

I'm not a full-stack developer. But I like to think of myself, **humbly**, as a full-stack creative.

Being full-stack is useful in a development context, but it’s even more useful in a creative context. 

To create a smooth, cohesive experience that is fast and fun, a project needs to have a vision that holds it all together.

I’ve invested a lot of time developing expertise in the breadth of creative and technical disciplines that go into creating a cohesive online experience. 

That means UI/UX design, graphic design, illustration, photography, animation, copywriting, and front-end development.

Being able harmonize those skills enables me to create compelling, fun work without having to rely on a modular team of specialists, and it unlocks really cool things. 

That's really abstract, though. Let me tell you about something more specific.

## Take, for instance, the humble SVG…

Oh. You might not know what an SVG is. 

An SVG is a type of image format that contains instructions for your computer to draw lines and shapes. 

Most images you see online aren't like this. They're made of pixel data.

SVGs are awesome, because they are are incredibly small, infinitely resizable, and can be manipulated in real-time using css and javascript. 

*They take up virtually no space and you can animate them.*

That sounds amazing, but they are underused because neither frontend developers nor illustrators really know how to take advantage of them by themselves.

The possibility of the SVG isn't obivious unless you have both the artisic eye of an illustrator and the technical know-how of a frontend dev. 

There are lots of reasons for this, but the simplest is that SVGs often aren't the most obivous tool to use for either devs or creatives. 

But if you're looking at creative and devlopement as being conected, the techinal attributes of the SVG file-type let you do stuff that's hard to replicate without making your site huge.

High-res JPGs, GIF animations, and MP4 video files are nice and it's not wrong to use them, but they do add up quickly in digital weight.

Being a full-stack creative is about harmonizing creative vision with technical constraint. Hence, beautiful *and* perfomant websites.

## Pretty cool, huh

Yeah, ok. This is nerdy. But making cool websites is nerdy.

I'm not talking about SVGs because I want to give a TED talk on SVGs (which to be fair...I do want to do that). It's just one example of how technical skill and creative vision can tie together.

The truth is most of my sites are not 678kb or even close. This site is a overkill in its slimness. 

It's a demo site. But I think it’s cool how tight you can make a site if you want. 

There are lots of other ways to harmonize technical knowledge with creative vision. But one example is enough. I don't want to bore you.

## Let's make something

So it all comes down to this--let's make something. If you want a website that feels fresh and fun and fast, I can help.
