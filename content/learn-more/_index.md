## Hi, I'm Benjamin

My philosophy of web design is simple. Websites should be fun. 

Obviously your website should be functional and easy to use. 

That's first. But that's boring. You can do better. 

Make them fun too!

That doesn’t mean they need to be extravagant or technically sophisticated. But they should have a sense of play and excitement built in from the very start.

This means different things in different contexts, and doesn’t apply to the same degree in every situation. 

But any time one of your goals is get people excited about you, it’s important that you communicate that you are excited to be you. 

You do this by having fun.

## Ummm...what even does that mean?

Fun! Just make your site fun. There's no formula. 

But ok, yes. I can see how that's unhelpful.

**Here's what fun might look like:**

Sometimes it might mean investing in beautiful illustration or photography and letting it shine. 

Sometimes it might mean building in special interactions and animations.

Sometimes it might not even be part of the web design itself. If the site is built around recurring content (say...a blog) that content can be the source of fun.

But your site can't just be fun. It needs to be fast too.

## This entire website is 654kb. That's very small.

That’s kilobytes. The one that’s smaller than megabytes. 

This entire website is smaller than most banner images. 

*But wait...does that includes all the fun images and animations on the home page?*

Yes. Those too.

Being fun doesn’t mean building a bulky, boorish website that *might* be fun if you have a perfect connection.

Guess what. No one has a perfect conection.

One thing that is not fun is waiting for a site to load.

## Full-Stack Creative

'Full-stack' is a term from the development world for a developer who is skilled at every level of development. 

I'm not a full-stack developer. But I like to think of myself, **humbly**, as a full-stack creative.

Being full-stack is useful in a development context, but it’s even more useful in a creative context. 

To create a smooth, cohesive experience that is fast and fun, a project needs to have a vision that holds it all together.

I’ve invested a lot of time developing expertise in the breadth of creative and technical disciplines that go into creating a cohesive online experience. 

That means UI/UX design, graphic design, illustration, photography, animation, copywriting, and front-end development (HTML/CSS/JS and templating).

It seems like a small thing, but being able harmonize those skills enables me to create compelling, fun work without having to rely on a modular team of specialists, and it unlocks really cool things. 

Take, for instance, the humble SVG… 

## All hale the SVG

Oh. You might not know what an SVG is. 

An SVG is a type of image format that all web browsers can read that stores vectors instead of bitmaps. That means instead of containing a bunch of pixels, it contains instructions for your computer to draw lines and shapes and color them in. 

SVG images are incredibly small, infinitely resizable, and can be manipulated in real-time using css and javascript. *They take up virtually no space and you can animate them.* That sounds amazing, but they are highly underused, because neither web-devs or illustrators really know how to take advantage of them on their own. 

People mostly just use SVGs for little UI components—logos, buttons, and icons. When they want to create a creatively expressive site they fall back to using bulky components—high-res JPG images, GIF animations, and MP4 video files—which add up quickly in digital weight.

The possibility of the SVG doesn’t become apparent unless you both have the creative vision of an illustrator and the technical know-how of a frontend dev. That’s how this site is only 678kb and still does a great job of communicating in a beautiful, interactive way. Being a full-stack creative is about harmonizing creative vision with technical constraint.

## Pretty Cool, huh

Yeah, ok. This site is a little overkill in its slimness, but I think it’s cool that you can make fun stuff that is lightning quick. 

The truth is most of my sites are not 678kb or even close. Great photography is really important, and I love photography (you can see some of my own work at my personal blog https://BNJMN.us). SVGs are just a tool and there are some trade-offs you make when using SVGs, but it’s an example of the type of thing you can do when you’re able to see the whole stack. Fun does not equal bloated.

## Lets Make Something

I’m not quite sure how I want to finish off this pitch, but I am definitely going to put something here. That’s for sure.
